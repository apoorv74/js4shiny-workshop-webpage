### RStudio Desktop

We're going to use [RStudio Desktop][rstudio-desktop] in this workshop. Yes, you can even do web development work in RStudio!

:computer: Please make sure you have a recent version of RStudio installed. Version 1.2 or later will work.

### RStudio Cloud

There will also be an [RStudio Cloud][rstudio-cloud] instance
that can be used as a backup.
I'll post the link here, just prior to the start of the workshop.
