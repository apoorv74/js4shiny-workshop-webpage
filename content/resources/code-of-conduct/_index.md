Any rule or procedure of the official conference code of conduct
supercede the guidelines listed below.

## Workshop Code Of Conduct

All attendees, instructors, teaching assistants and volunteers at our wokrshop are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.

### The Quick Version

Our workshop is dedicated to providing a harassment-free workshop experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of workshop participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any workshop venue, including Twitter and other online media.

### The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the workshop organizers will coordinate with rstudio::conf organizers to take appropriate action.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the workshop staff immediately.

Workshop staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all workshop venues and conference-related social events.
